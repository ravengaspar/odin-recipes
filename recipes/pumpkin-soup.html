    <h2>Description</h2>
    <section>
      It’s easy to make and the leftovers taste even better the next day. So,
      you could certainly make the soup a day in advance. Don’t be intimidated
      by the ingredient list—this soup only requires basic pantry ingredients!
    </section>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>olive oil</li>
      <li>sugar pie pumpkin</li>
      <li>chopped yellow onion</li>
      <li>minced garlic cloves</li>
      <li>seas salt</li>
      <li>ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>cloves</li>
      <li>cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>ground black pepper</li>
      <li>vegetable broth</li>
      <li>full fat coconut milk</li>
      <li>maple syrup</li>
      <li>pepitas</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and line a baking sheet with
        parchment paper for easy cleanup. Carefully halve the pumpkin and scoop
        out the seeds (you can roast the seeds if you’d like—see note—but you
        won’t need them for this recipe).
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice each pumpkin halve in half to make quarters. Brush or rub 1
        tablespoon olive oil over the flesh of the pumpkin and place the
        quarters, cut sides down, onto the baking sheet. Roast for 35 minutes or
        longer, until the orange flesh is easily pierced through with a fork.
        Set it aside to cool for a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large Dutch oven or
        heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add
        onion, garlic and salt to the skillet. Stir to combine. Cook, stirring
        occasionally, until onion is translucent, about 8 to 10 minutes. In the
        meantime, peel the pumpkin skin off the pumpkins and discard the skin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the pumpkin flesh, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, cayenne pepper (if
        using), and a few twists of freshly ground black pepper. Use your
        stirring spoon to break up the pumpkin a bit. Pour in the broth. Bring
        the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 15 minutes,
        to give the flavors time to meld.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the soup is cooking, toast the pepitas in a medium skillet over
        medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until fragrant, golden and making
        little popping noises. You want them to be nice and toasty, but not
        burnt. Transfer pepitas to a bowl to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the pumpkin mixture is done cooking, stir in the coconut milk and
        maple syrup. Remove the soup from heat and let it cool slightly. You can
        use an immersion blender to blend this soup in the pot. I prefer to use
        my stand blender, which yields the creamiest results—working in batches,
        transfer the contents of the pan to a blender (do not fill your blender
        past the maximum fill line!). Securely fasten the blender’s lid and use
        a kitchen towel to protect your hand from steam escaping from the top of
        the blender as you purée the mixture until smooth. Transfer the puréed
        soup to a serving bowl and repeat with the remaining batches.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste and adjust if necessary (I thought the soup was just right as is,
        but you might want to add more coconut milk for extra creaminess/milder
        flavor, or maple syrup to make it a little sweeter).
      </li>
      <li>
        Ladle the soup into individual bowls. Sprinkle pepitas over the soup and
        serve. Let leftover soup cool completely before transferring it to a
        proper storage container and refrigerating it for up to 4 days
        (leftovers taste even better the next day!). Or, freeze this soup for up
        to 3 months.
